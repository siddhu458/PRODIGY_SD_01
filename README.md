Here’s how the program works:
      1.The user inputs a temperature value and the original unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
      2.Based on the original unit, the program converts the temperature to the other two units.
      3.It then displays the converted values.
Feel free to customize this program further or add error handling as needed. Happy coding! 🌡️🔥❄️
I provided a detailed Python program that meets the user’s request. The program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales and displays the converted values. I also included error handling for invalid input.
